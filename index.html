RBC is ranked the number one largest bank in Canada and one of largest in the world. This financial institution provides numerous products and services to its clients, partners and sponsorships. Some of their products include day-to-day banking applications and accounts, credit card lines, investment banking solutions - RBC Ventures, mortgage solutions and corporate banking options.</p>

                        <p class="workterm-sub-subheading">As a co-op student at the bank, I worked within the OMNI group. OMNI is responsible for designing, developing, testing and deploying online banking applications for day-to-day banking, home investments, onboarding new clients, creating new accounts, and other online banking services which can all be accessed by any RBC client at a local branch or on their personal devices. In addition to implementing new widgets, all journeys and squads within OMNI follow <a href="https://www.synopsys.com/glossary/what-is-agile-sdlc.html#:~:text=Agile%20SDLC%20methodology%20is%20based,last%20two%20to%20four%20weeks" target="_blank">agile</a> ways of working to improve work efficiency and welcome new changes easily later in the software development process.</p>

                        <h3>Job Description/My Role at RBC-OMNI</h3>
                        <p>With the global spread Covid-19, more and more essential businesses are finding ways to provide their services online and remotely. As a bank and large corporation, many RBC products and services which were originally offered in person - in local branches were shifted entirely online. As for the existing online tools and applications before the pandemic, many were updated to provide an easier user experience and a seamless onboarding procedure for welcoming new clients.</p>
                        <p>As for my role at the bank, I was a software developer co-op on the Nebula squad within the Choose A Bank journey at RBC - OMNI from May 2020 to December 2020. The Choose A Bank journey handles the implementation and deployment of widgets for onboarding new clients and helping them create new primary and/or secondary accounts. My squad was specifically responsible for the series of document review screens which are presented to the client and/or branch advisor when they are in the process of creating a new bank account. These series of digital widgets are compiled together to build an entire 'Account Open' flow and are designed to work on desktops, tablets and mobile devices. With the expansion of the types of bank accounts offered to clients and banking promotions, these widgets were consistently updated along with introducing new ones. Ultimately, this impacts the front-end - updating the visual components along with the back-end - calling the appropriate server endpoints and storing relevant data. </p>

                        <h4 class="workterm-sub-subheading">The First Work Term</h4>
                        <p class="workterm-sub-subheading">For the first four months of my co-op experience, I worked with the team that handles front-end technologies related to the document review pages of the new client/account onboarding tool. The OMNI front-end infrastructure mainly uses <a href="https://angular.io/guide/architecture" target="_blank">Angular</a> (TypeScript), HTML and CSS to implement changes. Being new to Angular, it was a bit of a learning curve for me. Fortunately, RBC employees have access to a learning database called <a href="https://degreed.com/" target="_blank">Degreed</a> which has many resources on Angular and it allowed me to grasp the content a lot faster. Along with the continuous support from my mentor via pair programming sessions, helpful PR (pull request) comments and knowledge share sessions presented by the Front-end Chapter, it was easy to learn these new technologies.</p>
                        <p class="workterm-sub-subheading">Getting a grasp of the enterprise tools used (Git, Jira, Jenkins, Nexus Repository Manager, Urban Code Deploy and Taplytics) was not difficult once I had worked on more stories. Over the course of these four months, I got to build a few new screens in the 'Account Open' flow regarding a client's 'Pin Disclosure' agreement, collecting their responses when opting into VIP banking programs along with <a href="https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/regression-testing-tools-and-methods/" target="_blank">regression testing</a> these pages for responsiveness. Working with the front-end was definitely rewarding as I got see my work reflected on the actual product which thousands of RBC clients continue to use today.</p>
                        
                        <br>

                        <h4 class="workterm-sub-subheading">The Second Work Term</h4>
                        <p class="workterm-sub-subheading">The OMNI infrastructure surrounds the idea of <a href="https://skillcrush.com/blog/front-end-back-end-full-stack/" target="_blank">full stack</a> development. Hence, I decided to learn about the back-end technologies used within the Choose A Bank journey for my second co-op work term at RBC. While I was still working with the back-end services of the same document review widget which I had worked with in the previous term, things were a lot different. For starters, the code implementation and unit testing were completed in Java using the <a href="https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot" target="_blank">Spring Boot</a> framework, and once again the Degreed learning database was extremely helpful. Bash scripts were used for post-implementation verification testing and Pivotal Cloud Foundry logs, Postman mock requests, Dynatrace 'pure paths' along with Splunk dashboards were created and used to filter through HTTP requests and responses when each endpoint was reached in both the demo and final production environments. This time, I received the help of another mentor on my squad who specializes in back-end services along with the OMNI Back-end Chapter to understand and confidently use these technologies in my daily work.</p>
                        <p class="workterm-sub-subheading">During this term, some of the stories (tasks) which I got work on were updating message templates that appear in the banking portal once a client logs in, working with APIs to store appropriate data when endpoints were called and filtering through a large amount of logs using queries to better analyse raised exceptions and response times for endpoints.</p>

                        <h4 class="workterm-sub-subheading">Highlights of my Co-op Experience at RBC</h4>
                        <p class="workterm-sub-subheading">Along with the daily work, I had the opportunity to participate in the RBC Innovation Challenge which is designed to help new co-op students network with one another across various disciplines and use open source APIs to create sustainable solutions related to the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>
                        <p class="workterm-sub-subheading">I also had the opportunity of being the scrum master for my squad for the duration of 2 sprints (1 sprint = 2 weeks). I was responsible for facilitating the daily stand-up meetings, reporting any major conflicts to members of other squads and organizing other agile ceremonies such as squad reviews, internal refinement sessions and squad retrospectives. Taking on this role taught me a lot about problem solving, professional communication and time management.</p>
                        <p class="workterm-sub-subheading">Towards the end of my second term, all co-ops within RBC-OMNI had the chance to compete in an automated snake (game) competition organized by <a href="https://play.battlesnake.com/" target="_blank">Battlesnake</a>. My fellow Choose A Bank co-op students and I teamed up to build an automated snake using JavaScript which then competed against other snakes built by other teams. This was a great way to finish off the work term and connect with other co-op students within OMNI.</p>

                        <h3>Goals</h3>
                        <p>At the start of each co-op term my mentor, manager and I discussed a few technical and non-technical goals which I've described below.</p>

                        <h4 class="workterm-sub-subheading">Become Proficient with Front-end Languages and Technologies</h4>
                        <p class="workterm-sub-subheading">For my first work term at RBC, one of my goals was to successfully learn and use the front-end languages and frameworks used within OMNI. Becoming proficient with Angular (using TypeScript) has allowed me to gain exposure to front-end technologies which has increased my skillset, uncover more pathways for my future career and allowed me to complete daily tasks quickly and efficiently. Throughout the progression of this term, I accomplished this goal by completing a learner's guide for Angular and performing code reviews on the existing code base to understand the coding conventions and functionality. From this, I was able to pick up a variety of different front-end stories to gain more experience along with making my own judgments to better analyze code and prevent any errors before I presented my work before the entire squad.</p>

                        <br>

                        <h4 class="workterm-sub-subheading">Time Management</h4>
                        <p class="workterm-sub-subheading">RBC offers many opportunities to their co-op students such as engaging in challenges and projects outside of our daily work. Hence, one of my goals for the summer work term was to manage my time better so that I could participate in these extra-curricular activities. Learning to use my time wisely and efficiently has better prepared me for larger work tasks, taking on agile roles such as scrum master and allowed me to better understand the concept of project management. I accomplished this goal by using the Outlook Calendar tool and creating mental checkpoints for each story that worked on. As I found myself completing my tasks within timeframes, I decided to take on the role of scrum master which is about facilitating team meetings to prevent future conflicts and going overtime. In addition, I was able to participate in the RBC Innovation Challenge and community meetings.</p>

                        <br>
                        
                        <h4 class="workterm-sub-subheading">Teamwork and Collaboration with Agile</h4>
                        <p class="workterm-sub-subheading">In school we're taught about agile, but we rarely have the chance to work in such an environment. Seeing as many technological institutions including RBC-OMNI are applying agile ways of working to better perform daily tasks, facilitate problems efficiently and provide continuous delivery of their products, my goal for the summer term was to learn professional and ethical behavior when working in an agile team. Learning to work in this environment has allowed me to understand the company culture better and communicate effectively when working with others. I was able to successfully accomplish this goal by attending RBC-OMNI's 'Ways of Working' seminar and contacting the Choose A Bank journey's agile coach for resources on adapting to an agile environment. Attending the seminar was extremely helpful as many collaboration scenarios and project management tools were explained. Learning this information made me better prepared for daily agile ceremonies such as stand up meetings, squad reviews, retrospectives and refinements where I engaged with all squad members such as developers, business analyst, product manager and UI designers.</p>

                        <br>
                        
                        <h4 class="workterm-sub-subheading">Become Proficient with Back-end Languages and Technologies</h4>
                        <p class="workterm-sub-subheading">One of my goals for my fall co-op work term at RBC was to become proficient with back-end programming languages, tools and technologies used within the OMNI infrastructure. Understanding and implementing programs in the back-end has supported my long-term goal to work with full stack technologies and create personal projects. Specifically, I wanted to learn about the Spring Boot framework, downstream services, mocking services such as Postman and implementing JUnit tests for Java classes and methods. By attending bi-weekly Back-end Chapter meetings, pair programming with my mentor and participating in Spring Boot sprints with other employees, I was able to accomplish this goal. In addition, I was able to learn more about enterprise tools (Pivotal Cloud Foundry, Splunk, Dynatrace, Apache JMeter, and Postman) which support back-end development. From this, I was able to complete various types of back-end stories and participate in code swarming sessions.</p>

                        <br>
                        
                        <h4 class="workterm-sub-subheading">Networking</h4>
                        <p class="workterm-sub-subheading">As a co-op student, it's important to reach out and connect with other co-ops, full-time employees and senior employees to better understand organizational roles and company culture at a large corporation such as RBC. When entering my second work term, networking was an important goal for me as it has given me exposure to different roles when considering paths for my future career and identify persons of contact when working with APIs. I achieved this goal by participating in co-op community meetings, connecting with others via virtual coffee chats, hosting bi-weekly knowledge share sessions for the Choose A Bank journey, and communicating with members of other squads when working on overlapping banking widgets. I made sure to set time aside for these meetings in order to see this goal through fruition.</p>

                        <h4 class="workterm-sub-subheading">Professional (Verbal and Virtual) Communication</h4>
                        <p class="workterm-sub-subheading">My final goal for my second work term at RBC was to improve my professional communication. When working entirely remotely, things sometimes get misunderstood and even overlooked so it was important that I learn to communicate effectively in this virtual working environment. To make sure to see this goal accomplished before the end of my work term, I actively participated in squad discussions where I was able to interact, learn and question information which affected my work. Preparing before these meetings allowed to me to foresee the topic of discussion and present my thoughts and opinions a lot more articulately. Another way I accomplished this goal was meeting with my manager, mentors and technical squad lead every month to get feedback on my work and exercise my communication skills.</p>

                        <h3>Concluding Thoughts</h3>
                        <p>Working (remotely) at RBC for the past eight months was an incredible learning and co-op opportunity. This experience not only taught me a lot about the technological industry, but also about the community one is a part of when working at a large organization, the accomplishments of hard work and exposure to real-world applications.</p>
                        <p>At RBC collaboration, recognition and diversity play a huge role for creating an efficient work environment. To me, these were the most interesting aspects of my job. Even with a virtual working environment, I received the best support and knowledge transfer from my mentors, my manager and the front-end and back-end chapters within OMNI. Code live shares, pair programming, completing tech debts and participating in retrospectives allowed me to improve on my daily work and to learn more about various tools and technologies.</p>
